##Notes for LeapTrainer:##

We should look at "wake gestures". This would be a predefined motion or gesture that would initiate the sign2speech agent to wake and look for a gesture or motion to translate. I would allow us to give the user a response (I am thinking a vibration) that would allow them to know that the system is on and working.

We should look at running a "Auto-tuning" diagnostic each device/user by having a core number of words that the trainer should be able to optimize from. The user will set up the device and run through the known set of words and the device will toggle through the different recognition and recording
